# Text Generation QT - SnaQT

A QT UI for Text Generation with a variety of API's and toolkits. Targeting the crown for FOSS Android text generation UI.

## Confirmed working platforms:
1. Windows 11
2. Android via PyDroid3
3. Ubuntu 23.10

## Installation

Download the release, ensure Python 3 is installed, any recent version should do but it's been tested on 3.10 and 3.11 .  Then, open up a terminal, navigate to your repository. Once there execute

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```

## Notes

For now, the only chat mode is for Together Computer's serverless inference endpoints API. My expanded API of 3d generation and image generation is to be added "soon".
